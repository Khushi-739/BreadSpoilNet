BreadSpoilNet: Convolutional Neural Network-Based Early Detection and Shelf Life Prediction for Bakery Products

Overview

This project focuses on predicting the shelf life of bakery products using Deep Learning techniques. Developed between August 2024 and December 2024 under the University of Mumbai, it utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect spoilage early and recommend appropriate usage. The primary aim is to minimize food wastage by providing actionable insights into product freshness.

Project Details

A CNN-based model was designed to predict the shelf life of bakery items with an accuracy of approximately 90%. The system can detect signs of spoilage and localize the affected regions, ensuring timely usage. The model is integrated with a Flask-based front-end, offering users an interactive platform to upload food images and receive spoilage detection results. The integration between the trained model and the front end ensures efficient predictions without compromising data integrity. Currently, the project is being optimized to enable real-time predictions and future integration into a mobile application.

Motivation

Food spoilage detection has traditionally relied on microbiological and chemical testing methods, which are slow, costly, and sometimes destructive to the products. This project introduces an AI-driven solution that uses non-invasive techniques to detect spoilage early. By shifting towards automated, deep learning-based detection methods, the project aims to reduce food waste significantly while promoting more sustainable food safety practices.

Key Technologies

The project leverages CNNs for feature extraction and classification, Flask for the front-end framework, and Python-based tools for model training and integration. Training was initiated using Google's Teachable Machine, followed by the use of TensorFlow and Keras libraries to enhance model robustness and accuracy. Advanced image processing techniques were employed to ensure early and accurate detection of spoilage stages.

Future Scope

The project plans to integrate real-time prediction capabilities within a mobile application, expand the dataset to cover a wider range of bakery products, and incorporate environmental factors such as temperature and humidity for enhanced prediction accuracy. Additionally, integrating nutritional analysis features and supply chain monitoring tools could further expand the system's practical applications, offering comprehensive solutions to food safety and inventory management challenges.

University Association

This project is associated with the University of Mumbai, Department of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. It was carried out under the guidance of Prof. Firdous Shaikh during the academic period from August 2024 to December 2024.
